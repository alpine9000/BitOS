Generating constraints for global initializers

ANYTHING = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = *ESCAPED
ESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN
*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &ESCAPED
INTEGER = &ANYTHING

Generating constraints for main (main)

i = &NULL
foo.arg0 = &i
main.use = &i
main.clobber = foo.clobber
main.use = foo.use
i.0_4 = i
main.clobber = ESCAPED
main.use = ESCAPED
main.result = &NULL

Generating constraints for foo (foo)

derefaddrtmp = &NONLOCAL
*foo.arg0 = derefaddrtmp
foo.clobber = foo.arg0

Rewriting constraints and unifying variables
Unifying main.clobber to main.use
Unifying foo.clobber to foo.arg0
foo.use is a non-pointer variable,ignoring constraint:main.use = foo.use
Uniting pointer but not location equivalent variables
Unifying i to i.0_4
Finding indirect cycles
Solving graph
