BitOS - The operating system for the BitMachine SH7058 emulator 
===============================================================

Copyright (C) Enable Software Pty Ltd 2014

BitOS is a very basic newlib based operating system. BitMachine is browser based emulator that emulates a basic SH7058 "like" computer.

The operating system emulates file I/O, graphics, keyboard, mouse and sound. The most significant thing is can do is recompile itself using GCC (sans newlib).

It was hacked together to excerise the BitMachine SH7058 instruction set emulation.

Notes:
------
o Built on OSX El Capitan 10.11.2
o You need a google drive with a folder called ~/Google Drive/BitFS that syncs from your build machine

*Install xcode from app store

(1) install xcode command line tools
=====================================
xcode-select --install
mkdir ~/Projects
mkdir ~/Projects/bitos-build/
mkdir ~/Projects/bitos-build/src
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/alpine9000/BitOS.git

(2) build external components
==============================

cd ~/Projects/BitOS/external
make # This will take hours to complete

 Make will download and install the following:
 o wget-1.16 -> /usr/local
 o osx gcc-5.3.0 -> /usr/local
 o sh-elf cross gcc-5.3.0 -> /usr/local/sh-elf
 o sh-elf cross binutils-2.25 -> /usr/local/sh-elf
 o sh-elf newlib-2.0.0 -> /usr/local/sh-elf
 o sh-elf readline-6.3 -> /usr/local/sh-elf

 It will also build the following ready for hosting on BitOS:
 o gcc-5.3.0
 o bintils-2.25
 o make-4.1

(3) make filesystem.zip
========================
cd ~/Projects/BitOS
make gdrivefs # This will copy filesystem.zip to ~/Google Drive/BitFS

(4) Setting local filesystem
=============================
* Navigate to https://alpine9000.github.io/BitMachine/ (Chrome works best)
* Menu "Drive" -> "Initialise Filesystem from Google Grive"

(5) Rebuild bitos in BitMachine
================================
* Navigate to https://alpine9000.github.io/BitMachine/ (Chrome works best)
* Menu "Drive" -> "Boot BitOS from Google Drive"
cd /usr/local/src/BitOS
make elf
* Menu "Drive" -> "Boot BitOS from Local"

You are now running bitos built on bitos (-:

(6) Make a change to the OS
============================
* Navigate to https://alpine9000.github.io/BitMachine/ (Chrome works best)
* Menu "Drive" -> "Boot BitOS from Google Drive"
bemacs /usr/local/src/BitOS/libbitmachine/shell.c (Change the version function to print something else)
* Follow previous step (Rebuild bitos in BitMachine)
version

(7) Other Things To Try
========================

bemacs - emacs "like" editor (Ersatz emacs - https://github.com/stangelandcl/ersatz-emacs)
rwolf - simple raycasting demo (http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)
si - Start of a Space Invaders tribute
ps - See some process information
free - See some memory usage stats
ls/dir/cat/rm/mkdir/pwd/mv/cp - simple unix commands
kernel - boot a new kernel

(8)Some BitMachine stuff to try from the javascript console
============================================================
kernel.init() // Enable stack tracing
kernel.PrintThreadTable() // Prints information about the running threads
kernel.kernel.DumpStack() // Shows the stack traces of each thread
